# Overview
<br>
What will Olist's future sales look like? From which kind of customer and from which region will they occur?
<br>
Moreover, which regions are the most valuable to the company in terms of total customers and total sales?
<br>

# Business Problem
<br>
Managers at Olist need to understand future demand in number and geography in order to properly allocate capital across their operations.
This analysis seeks to analyze sales data across Brazils' states to drive actionable insight. My method will consist of 3 objectives:
<br>

1. Geospatial Analysis
<br>
2. Segmentation Analysis
<br>
3. Time Series Forecasting of Sales
<br>
Finally, I will provide recommendations on where to allocate capital to best position the firm to provide value for its customers.
